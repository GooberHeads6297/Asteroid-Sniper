# Asteroid-Sniper

Simple game where you shoot asteroids like one of those 1990's space shooting games.

This was a project I left alone for a while due to the lack of tools and knowlage for A.I I had at the time.

Thanks to A.I intergration into VSCode it made my dream of making this game into a reality!


Note:

  When using the game through the online link the heartDead.png for some reason doesn't load. I think it may be due to the Github Pages because the script references the file properly.

  # For now I would advise downloading it locally
